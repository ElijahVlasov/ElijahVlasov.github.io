experience:
  - role: Cryptography Researcher and Formal Verification Engineer 
    name: Nethermind
    location: London, UK
    date: Mar 2022 - Present
    points:
      - Co-authored Mova folding scheme, 
        i.e. a cryptographic protocol that allows for an untrusted party
        to securely prove correct aggregation of multiple instances of certain computation. 
        Proved its cryptographic security properties. Led implementation of the protocol.      
      - Led a team of 5 engineers implementing the first lattice-based cryptographic folding scheme
        called LatticeFold in Rust. Worked on researching opportunities to apply the scheme in the context 
        of scalable transparent arguments of knowledge (STARKs).
      - Formally verified parts of a RISC-V zk virtual machine Risc0 in Lean proof assistant.
      - Contributed into development of a Cairo virtual machine written in Golang. Advised on cryptographic aspects.
      - Worked on a Solidity formal verification tool called Clear.   
      - Participated in the development of the Horus security analysis tool for Cairo smart contract programming language in Haskell. 
  - role: Research Engineer 
    name: Sofoil
    location: Kazan, Russia
    date: Aug. 2021 - Feb. 2022
    points:
      - Participated in the development of a training simulator for petroleum geologists called PolyPlan.
      - Developed from scratch a microservice that performs calculation of pressure build-up/fall-off in oil wells 
        in the presence of external factors using Python. 
        Assisted senior researchers in developing mathematical models of such behaviour.       
projects:
  - name: Gitlytics
